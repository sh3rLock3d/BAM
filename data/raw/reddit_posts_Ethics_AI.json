                "body": "1) It isn't in time-unconstrained, and resource-irrelevant contexts (I'll explain in a bit what I mean).\n\n2) Too much a crystal ball requiring question. It's like asking if Googling things right in the middle of a discussion is the future of common parlance - as we can see now that we've come here, it's not common because deep esoteric understanding isn't a common requisite or something that gets invoked in \"everyday parlance\". By definition everyday parlance is devoid of having to do this sort of weird \"holdon let me get my phone and AI to explain things to me first, and maybe to you since I'm not sure you know what you're talking about because I'm definitely not understanding\". And with this answer, the answer to question #1 is more elaborated on. You can't go around having normal everyday conversations and demanding every statement be qualified with some authoritative and syllogistic rigor. If in the year 3000 we all have brain implants, sure maybe the augmentation will make this sort of act trivial, and it would be what everyday parlance looks like. Any near imaginable future though? Absolutely not.\n\n3) It is, based on context. Say for example if this is a formal debate. But then you decided to invoke an esoteric aspect into the debate that not even the audience grasps - it goes down two ways. First you're being unethical because you knew the opponent wasn't going to be ready for something of this caliber, and may not be ready because they don't pay for some ChatGPT-like service they can bring up really quick to make an eventual counter. The second is, even if they do have the same readiness as you - the formal debate formats usually prohibit this sort of behavior as it can easily be abused as a stall tactic and a manipulative form of debate (which is why proper debates are like court cases, everyone submits the evidence they'll draw from in the debate before the debate). And in some cases, written formal debates last months as the two debaters are given weeks to fully reply to points made without the pitfalls of time-gated in-person formal debates which are mostly used as rhetoric entertainment events.\n\n4a) It is because you question just stipulated it is. By saying something like \"given the right inputs\" it begs the question against the possibility of yielding inconsistent results. If you're asking the question of how this pans out in reality - then obviously the simply answer is no, because AI isn't an omniscient tool.\n\n4b) This is a semantic question. I can say reality is whatever I see, and that's what reality then becomes because I simply declared such is my definition. (This question is over a term that both people need to agree a definition upon. In isolation it doesn't matter what \"reality\" is, I can say reality is water and it wouldn't matter). But if you need to settle on something non-contentious, just pick up a bunch of dictionaries and chose whichever definition jives with you.\n\n4c) See above.\n\n5) No, because it's again, a personal question based on the observer. If I told you 9/10 a hypothetically unbiased AI will give the most agreed upon answers by all groups, but 1/10 it will give an utterly nonsensical and stupid answer but we could never tell... Many people will accept that's trustworth enough. But if someone running mathematical proofs is asked this question, the answers the AI gives may need to be 100% correct and logically sound before ANY trust is given. Again, the results you want from the AI have to be something in accordance to a goal you desire. If you don't care about racist AI, but it can somehow solve any mathematical problem in existence today - that might be enough for your research. While someone looking for social reform answers, may not care what that AI has to say. If you \"filter\" everything from an AI, then there's nothing left? The least filtered response is helpful when you want to understand how the AI functions. It's not helpful when you want to dig through the mounds of shit AI will spew at times. Again, all context related questions that you need to be more specific with (otherwise you get long replies like mine trying to cover as many bases as I can in a reddit post format).\n\n6) Not a question of ethics in principal, but it is the ethical thing to not try and bog an opponent down with minutia as a form of chest puffing. This is unethical in the sens of being supremely dishonest if the goal of the debate is truth seeking. If the form of debate is to slander and rhetorically make the other person look as bad as possible by using any sort of tactic at your disposal, then obviously the ethics question expands in scope. It would be like asking: \"Is it ethical to expect MMA fighters all have to be human, as opposed to bringing Boston Dynamics robots into the fights?\".

I don't recall ever being part of a discussion where a theorem in invoked, and then the two people go with pen and paper over the whole thing to see if it has any flaws in the middle of a debate.\n\nTheorems in my view aren't really used for argument, but seemingly more for an establishment of what the terms of conversation will be, and what sort of logic is allowed.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nI think if you want to \"hone\" people for Christian apolegetics though, in general you have mostly two avenues. The first is what I mostly see, and that's hyperfixation on a concept where there is lots of room for multiple avenues of rhetoric in the form of trying to poke holes on some potential technicalities. This sort of honing is done in a similar vein to activism.. It's not supposed to be academic, but more of a show to put on for on-lookers to get them interested, and perhaps to sway their minds.\n\nThe other form of honing, is the acedemic sort, where arguments for, or against Christianity are broken down for their propositions and sets of premises. This requires learning fundamental rules of logic (the language so to speak). This sort of honing is something you do not necessarily to dunk on people primarily, but an actual tool to test the veracity of the other persons' claims and position overall. This requires somewhat suspension of the urge to put on a show for others, and is more of an honest exercise, where the consequences are higher in terms of you being able to hold, or not hold your position if truth seeking is something you value (for example if you have what you imagine is an air tight argument, and someone comes with a formalized demonstration of a contradiction on your view, you have to be honest enough to accept the weakening of your view, and you have to downgrade the confidence of the overall view you were trying to defend - and obviously other things like not deploying this now-false view upon other noobs that may not be aware of this view now being defeated).\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThere aren't many people involved with apolegetics that have the latter sort of motivation in my experience (they're not interested in making constant public shows since they're busy always doing the work), but that goes for most people who are involved in the business of worldview defense. There are certainly more people involved with rhetoric.\n\nPersonally I think any group does well when they have a mix of these two types of people (the academic seeking actual truth, while the other propagandist is involved in common debate in order to sway people to what he takes to be the un-shakable truth). It creates people who aren't all just slick mouthpieces, and also not book worms that rarely leaves the confines of their studies. You need both, someone who knows the actual arguments well enough, and can also relay them in a rhetorical manner with effectiveness.\n\nBut I believe, if you're interest is in long term viability and appreciation of outsiders (who may one day be potential group members) - that people be honed in the the academic sense more than the rhetorical. Because at least if you lose in the academic sense, and your view shifts - you can at least know you've gotten closer to a truth. Rhetoric being defeated is interesting to see like cheap entertainment, but no one expects anything to change from the loser (due to a dishonest or deep seated position they will never move from even after being shown as such). You don't want people to adopt your view on false pretenses, or shaky footing, because it may one day lead them to leave due to this unsavory position that led them to you originally.\n\nAs always though, it depends on your goals.",

Implications in the short term are just being a tool most artists will need to have in their toolkit (since AI isn't good enough to replace artists in totality, nor will it ever be in the same way robots aren't enough to have a fully mechanized factory without a single human regulating and keeping tabs on things).\n\n>How can we develop regulations that balance innovation and ethics?\n\nDevelop regulations that balance ethics? You mean how do we \"be ethical\" while allowing AI progress to continue at it's current rate? Well frankly, you cannot since the AI startups are being taken to court over obvious copyright violations of having their work wanton pillaged and used in training data they did not consent to. AI companies are hoping the legal system sees AI as nothing different from a person being \"inspired\" by someone else's work.\n\nInnovation will happen regardless, but a boatload of money by being an early pioneer (either the person selling land deeds, or person selling shovels somewhere where gold was struck).\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThere's also another ethical question few people care to ask much about, and it's concerning AI in general. AI for laborious repetitious tasks that no one considers fulfilling is great. But AI for things that are emotionally fulfilling or serve as what is classically understood to be hobbies is questionable.\n\nAnd the primary question being.. Why would we want to let the can of worms free on something people enjoy doing as leisure. It's obvious the biggest benefactors to this happening are corporations, and the biggest losers - basically artists trying to make a living out of a passion (and an aspirational one). So to let that just be surrendered to AI takeover strikes me as profoundly moronic on a societal level. The masses might be happy they don't have to hire a graphics artist to do their website banner or whatnot, but anyone that enjoys this type of work is basically screwed.",

Me and the rest of our team would love to know more about how people feel in regards to AI generated content and all the ethical and legal implications it may have.\n\nTo address your first point: we'd say that \"Respect\" in this context relates to recognizing and valuing human creativity and originality. Ethical issues with AI include the potential for biases in AI models, misuse of AI-generated content, and concerns about the transparency and accountability of AI systems. While some of these issues have existed before, AI's rapid development and deployment amplify their impact and require careful consideration. It's true that machines have been replacing humans in various sectors for decades. However, many believe that the difference with AI is its potential to replicate and even \"surpass\" certain creative tasks, which were traditionally thought to be uniquely human. While AI might not yet excel in original content creation, it can generate visual art, music, and writing that closely mimics human work, raising questions about the nature and meanings of \"creativity\" and \"authorship\".\n\nNow, these questions have many points in common with previous events and cultural movements in History. It's not the first time we question the concept of \"authorship\" nor of \"art\" itself (specially during the 1900s with works like \"The death of the author\" by R. Barthes, or in general the whole Dada and Neo Dada movements and Postmodernism).  \nWho is the author of a collage piece if its made of other people's creations?   \nIs the author the one who creates with his/her own two hands? (in this case most Renaissance artists could not be considered authors of their works, since they often worked with their pupils or assistants to create many works, specially larger ones).\n\nSorry for the digression, but we do believe it's important to look at similar events in the past, as you said, We've been replacing people with machines for decades. This is also true with the industrial revolution, only that instead of digital it was mechanical.\n\nLaws are formal regulations enforced by governing bodies, while ethics involve moral principles guiding behavior. AI introduces new challenges that existing tools didn't fully address, such as the need for ethical AI development practices, accountability for AI decisions, and the management of AI's impact on society. This requires a fresh look at both legal and ethical frameworks to ensure responsible use.  \n  \nSo, why did we focus on the creative field?  \nThe rise of AI does pose a risk of unemployment across various sectors, not just creative fields. However, creatives face unique challenges, as AI-generated content can devalue human artistry and undermine job security in these roles. Learning from past industrial shifts, like the auto industry's collapse, we need proactive measures to support displaced workers and encourage skill adaptation across all affected sectors.\n\nWe believe key ethical issues with AI include data privacy, bias and fairness, accountability, and the potential for misuse. Addressing these requires understanding how AI systems are trained, how they make decisions, and how they impact individuals and society. Engaging in open discussions about these concerns helps create a more informed and balanced approach to AI integration.",

You raise several important points that merit further discussion.\n\nYou're right that balancing ethical considerations with rapid AI advancement is challenging, especially when it comes to copyright violations. The legal system is currently grappling with how to address AI's use of copyrighted material in training data. Many AI companies argue that their use of data is akin to human inspiration, but this is a contentious issue that is still being debated in courts and among policymakers. As you said, time and pioneering are a key factors here since it directly influences economic profit. Innovation indeed drives significant economic incentives, and those who pioneer new technologies often reap substantial rewards. The down side though is that this \"gold rush\" mentality can sometimes overshadow the need for ethical considerations and the protection of individual creators' rights. It’s crucial to find a balance that fosters innovation while ensuring fair compensation and recognition for original creators.\n\nThe use of AI in tasks that people find emotionally fulfilling or consider hobbies is indeed a complex ethical issue. While AI can greatly benefit laborious and repetitive tasks, its encroachment into creative fields raises concerns about the value and significance of human creativity. It's important to question how much we want AI to take over areas that provide personal satisfaction and joy to individuals. The potential for AI to displace artists and those in creative professions is a significant concern. As you mentioned, the primary beneficiaries of this shift may be corporations, while artists and creatives could face job insecurity and devaluation of their work. It’s essential to consider how to support and protect those who make a living from their artistic passions in the face of advancing AI technologies.\n\nThis is exactly why we believe it's important to discuss these topics, while AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, including creative industries, we must carefully navigate the ethical landscape to ensure that innovation does not come at the expense of human creativity and the livelihoods of artists. This is what we mean with being ethical with technological innovation.",

                "body": "I'm a non offending pedophile. I fully support this idea.  Here is my argument.\n\nI think we can all agree that csem is amongst the most vile, horrific, and immoral inventions of mankind. That said, I think it's important to remember why it is bad. It is the comodification of the sexual abuse or exploitation of children.  Children can't consent to any form of sexual activity with adults and the viewing of theaterial causes egregious harm. My best friend is a child sex trafficking victim and there are many videos and images of her still circulating on the internet. She is as traumatized by the viewing of such imagery as she is by the abuse itself if not more so.  This is the first reason csem is horrific. It causes harm to the victim.\n\nAs a non offending pedophile I can tell you that csem is a blight on my community. There are many people I've met with this unchosen unwanted attraction who use csem and hate themselves for it. They want so badly to stop but in the age of the internet it is shockingly easy to come by. They are addicted and for many there is no help available.    They are often in such a state of self loathing despair that they lack the resolve to seek help even if it is. This is the second reason it is bad. It harms those who use it. \n\nDespite these two realities, we have a societal problem.  Csem is pervasive on the internet, and if anything, it's use is increasing rather than decreasing. Csem is already strongly punishedb and completely stigmatized in most countries but the use is not decreasing. This, to me, means that those who want to stop (most users per the research) can't.  There is a clear market and need for such material. As deeply uncomfortable as that may make us, it is clear from the reality we face. People will use images of children. Sexuality needs an outlet and it will find one. Right now the outlet it finds for far too many is incredibly harmful. It is csem.\n\nGiven this reality, my argument is simple.  If we could have policed and punished this stuff out of existence we would have done so already. Given that we can't, the best thing we can do is provide alternative ways that people sate this sexua need that do not cause harm, or cause minimal harm in exactly the same way we provide methadone to heroine addicts.\n\nMost people who see this argument will find it extremely distasteful.  I'll grant that right now. I'm a non offending pedophile and I find it distasteful.  I find everything about this ocursed sexuality distasteful.  That said, I can't change it and given the alternative this is the least distasteful solution as fiction carries none of the problems described above.\n\nNow I'm sure youv will argue that I should get therapy. I am in therapy and I know people who are using programs around the world that are enrolled in the gold standards of care including prevention project dunkelfeld.  Therapy does not change our sexuality. It teaches us to manage it.  Part of learning to manage it is learning to find outlets that don't harm kids. For some any manor of pornography is an escalation risk. They shouldn't view adult material of any kind. For others fictional outlets are invaluable in terms of getting away from outlets that cause harm.  Shouldn't that be encouraged? Also, many people have no access to therapy. Isn't this better?\n\nBut won't this encourage pedophelia?  No.  Violent video games and movies do not cause violence and pornography does not cause sexual attraction. They are both fictional outlets for behavioral desires that are not acceptable to act on in real life.   We know of no way to change sexual orientation. If it were were true that pornography could change sexuality, we could choose to be homosexual, heterosexual, or anything in between just by choosing the porn we watch.   I've tried pornography for people with sexual orientations other than mine and all it has done for me is to make me feel it is gross or boring.\n\nOk but won't this normalize pedophelia?  I have heard that phrase countless times and I've no idea at all what it means.  We are a minority that exists. It is normal for us to exist because we do, and do so everywhere.  I don't think it will make pedophelia socially acceptable for the same reasons that the growing genre of incest pornography hasn't made incest acceptable. I once saw a pornographic video in which a twenty something female football player engaged in a gangbang with an entire male football team and I've yet to see the news talk about the growing normality of female football players engaging in unprotected group sex with entire teams of the opposite gender. When you think about it, the idea that porn can make something normal is rather silly.\n\nBut it's still gross you say.   I agree. However, if I can choose gross and harmful or gross and hamless I know which one I choose.\n\nThe real problem in my opinion is that people feel that the desire for that kind of imagery with innocent children is gross. It is gross.  Nobody would choose this.  It is also a fact of life for many.  That is gross as well but how gross something is has no bearing on whether or not that thing exists. Pedophelia exists. We can't pretend it doesn't. In my opinion the only rational response to that truth is to give people as many ways to not hurt kids in the expression of a sexuality they didn't choose as we can.",

Well there are people and organizations that work to find children shown in images/videos of CSAM and if an AI image/video of CSAM is to realistic these organizations could end up searching for hundreds if not thousands of children who don't actually exist. Not only would searching for children who don't exist be a waste of their time but most importantly it mean less real children being sexually exploited by human traffickers would be found and brought to safety.

As deeply uncomfortable as that may make us, it is clear from the reality we face. People will use images of children. Sexuality needs an outlet and it will find one. Right now the outlet it finds for far too many is incredibly harmful. It is csem.\n\nI don't think I agree with this. You are acknowledging that there are non offending pedophiles that don't use CSEM or use it but are able to stop. This indicates there isn't a need for CSEM or AI versions of it that inevitably are going to become indistinguishable from real CSEM which opens up a whole host of ethical issues. \n\nSociety should work to find more ways to make it so pedophiles can live their lives without abusing children or using CSEM because that's proven to be possible.\n\nYou say that pedophilia needs an outlet (I really don't like equating pedophilia with a sexuality) but that outlet doesn't need to be CSEM or AI generated CSEM. That desire can be suppressed with assistance from therapy. I'm sure it's hard but people that are pedophiles should go through challenging experiences if it prevents them from harming children.   \n\n\n>Given that we can't, the best thing we can do is provide alternative ways that people sate this sexua need that do not cause harm, or cause minimal harm in exactly the same way we provide methadone to heroine addicts.  \n>  \n>Most people who see this argument will find it extremely distasteful.  I'll grant that right now. I'm a non offending pedophile and I find it distasteful.  I find everything about this ocursed sexuality distasteful.  That said, I can't change it and given the alternative this is the least distasteful solution as fiction carries none of the problems described above.\n\nThe problem with this analogy is a person doing heroin isn't harming anyone directly aside from themselves.\n\nA pedophile that seeks to harm a child is harming someone directly.\n\nThere are many other issues with the analogy, but that's a big one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But won't this encourage pedophelia? No. Violent video games and movies do not cause violence and pornography does not cause sexual attraction. They are both fictional outlets for behavioral desires that are not acceptable to act on in real life.\n\nIt's very clear that pornography does in fact influence and affect people's actual real life sex lives. For example, It's very common place for straight men to want to have anal sex with their girlfriends/wives or ejaculate on their faces because of the prevalence of these fetishes in pornography. \n\nPornography affects people's perceptions and expectations about real sex, including expectations about bodies. There are common racist and sexist tropes in porn that affect how people view other people in real life outside of the context of them watching porn.\n\nWhile violent movies and video games don't cause people to commit violent acts, they definitely do glamorize violence and that's probably not a good thing our society should encourage. \n\nLastly, I think you are making a genuine effort to speak with empathy and respect around this contentious subject, but here's some advice: Referring to an adult person's desire to want sexually assault children as \"their sexuality\" or \"just another sexual orientation\" does come off as very dismissive and like a major euphemism.

The stigma attached to pedophilia as a sexual orientation ensures that pedophiles live in emotional isolation and that young people with pedophilic feelings have nowhere to turn with their doubts and fears.

Wanting to fuck a kid is a *bad* thing to want. Solutions that allow the person to assent to that desire are, all else being equal, worse than those that don't.\n\nThe origin of this is Harry Frankfurt's distinction between first-order and second-order desires. First-order desire: \"I want to have sex with a child\" - not chosen, something that is experiences without it being 'willed'. Second-order desire: \"I want to have sex with a child, *but I wish I didn't*\".\n\nI'm interested in how we frame and shape second order desires. I think it is better for someone to say 'wanting to have sex with a child is a distorted desire that is bad for me and that I ought to acknowledge without assenting to' rather than 'there's nothing wrong with wanting to have sex with a child if I don't do it'. We can't stop these desires (that's conversation therapy). We can frame them in different ways, with different effects on the way people live.",

This is also an area where it's *really easy* to oversimplify without a second thought  because you are dealing with an idea that's inherently repulsive. I recognize what I'm saying might be very easy to dismiss but I'd humbly suggest there is more complexity to it that's very obvious when you live with it and very hard to see when you don't. \n\nOf course if someone were to say \"I want to fuck a child\" and proceeds to brainstorm ways for a computer to help them fantasize about the desire it's a clear cut \"no... that's bad, get help\". \n\nLikewise, if someone were to say \"I want to murder someone\" and then asks if its cool to fantasize about murdering their neighbor and ruminating on it any sane person would say \"no.. that's bad, get help\". \n\nBut if someone says \"I really like playing FPS video games\" no one would bat an eye. They love the fantasy of running around and killing people as effectively as possible, but we're also not worried about them doing it in real life. Why not? Well, presumably what they like about it is the mental challenge, the excitement, playing with friends, the strategy, etc. etc., and the concept of actually harming another human being is so repulsive that we don't even bat an eye at the fact that they're playing out a fantasy world where they kill people all the time. But you can see how someone who wanted to could oversimplify that to \"wanting to shoot people is a morally questionable desire, so assenting to it by preforming it in a fantasy world on a screen for hours on end is not a good thing.\"\n\nCurrently, largely due to the taboo on the subject, the word \"pedophilia\" has to be a blanket term for an enormous spectrum of \"desires\", in my view akin to as if \"murderer\" were used to describe everything from school shooters to violent video game enthusiasts (if it sounds like I'm making a stretch here *trust me I'm not*). It further obfuscates things that we don't have a concensus answer on \"what does it mean for a thought or desire to be *inherently bad\"* rather than just *\"*bad if acted on\" - and that most people dont understand how that's a false dichotomy (there are desires where \"if acted on\" has no meaning, e.g. \"i wish i lived in the 1700s\").",

        "title": "The Role of Explainable AI in Enhancing Trust and Accountability",
        "selftext": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved from a niche academic interest to a ubiquitous component of modern technology. Its applications are broad and diverse, ranging from medical diagnostics to autonomous vehicles, and it is reshaping industries and society at large. However, as AI systems become more embedded in critical decision-making processes, the demand for transparency and accountability grows. This has led to a burgeoning interest in Explainable AI (XAI), a subfield dedicated to making AI models more interpretable and their decisions more understandable to humans.\n\nExplainable AI addresses one of the fundamental challenges in AI and machine learning (ML): the \"black box\" nature of many advanced models, particularly deep learning algorithms. These models, while highly effective, often operate in ways that are not easily interpretable by humans, even by the engineers who design them. This opacity poses significant risks, particularly when AI is applied in sensitive areas such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains, the consequences of AI errors can be severe, and the need for stakeholders to understand how and why a model arrived at a particular decision is paramount.\n\nOne of the primary goals of XAI is to enhance trust in AI systems. Trust is a crucial factor in the adoption of any technology, and AI is no exception. When users can understand the rationale behind AI decisions, they are more likely to trust the system and feel confident in its outputs. This is particularly important in scenarios where AI systems are used to assist or replace human judgment. For example, in healthcare, an explainable AI system that can clarify how it reached a diagnosis will likely be more trusted by both doctors and patients, leading to better outcomes and greater acceptance of AI-driven tools.\n\nMoreover, explainability is essential for accountability. In many jurisdictions, there is growing regulatory pressure to ensure that AI systems do not perpetuate bias or make discriminatory decisions. Without transparency, it is challenging to identify and correct biases in AI models. Explainable AI enables developers and auditors to trace decisions back to their source, uncovering potential biases and understanding their impact. This capability is vital for creating AI systems that are not only effective but also fair and aligned with societal values.\n\nHowever, achieving explainability is not without its challenges. There is often a trade-off between the complexity of a model and its interpretability. Simple models, such as linear regressions, are easy to explain but may not capture the intricacies of data as effectively as more complex models like deep neural networks. On the other hand, the latter, while powerful, are notoriously difficult to interpret. Researchers in XAI are working to bridge this gap by developing methods that can provide insights into how complex models function without sacrificing too much of their predictive power.\n\nIn practice, XAI techniques include model-agnostic approaches, which can be applied to any AI model, and model-specific methods, which are tailored to particular types of algorithms. Model-agnostic techniques, such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), provide post-hoc explanations by approximating the model's behavior around specific predictions. These tools help users understand which features contributed most to a particular decision, offering a clearer picture of the model's inner workings.\n\nExplainable AI plays a pivotal role in the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. By making AI more transparent and understandable, XAI not only enhances trust but also ensures accountability, paving the way for broader and more ethical adoption of AI technologies. As AI continues to advance, the importance of explainability will only grow, making it a critical area of focus for researchers, developers, and policymakers alike.",
