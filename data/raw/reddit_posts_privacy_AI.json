He said AI will usher in a new era of surveillance that he gleefully said will ensure “citizens will be on their best behavior.”\n\nEllison made the comments as he spoke to investors earlier this week during an Oracle financial analysts meeting, where he shared his thoughts on the future of AI-powered surveillance tools.\n\nEllison said AI would be used in the future to constantly watch and analyze vast surveillance systems, like security cameras, police body cameras, doorbell cameras, and vehicle dashboard cameras.\n\n“We’re going to have supervision,” Ellison said. “Every police officer is going to be supervised at all times, and if there’s a problem, AI will report that problem and report it to the appropriate person.

It's your *OS*, it has full control over your(?) computer by design, and by extension so does Microsoft. You can only turn off what you know is there, and even then it's only really feasible if they let you.  \nThen the whole thing is a moving target. They have the ability to install updates/software remotely at any time. How can you know what vectors for that there are, how can you be *sure* you've disabled all of them? That they'll *stay* disabled?\n\nEven an external(!) firewall only really helps if you use a *whitelist* of known-good IPs and/or domains. Blacklisting is pointless, since you have no way to know every IP and domain they could possibly use. But if you lock down the thing that much, it'll be unusable as a general purpose PC.\n\nMost of us aren't security researchers. We have no realistic chance to \"skirt the privacy issues\". I mean, if it makes you sleep better, sure, \"turn off\" a few data sharing settings ...  \n\n***\n\nNo, it all boils down to **trust**.\n\nAs your OS vendor, Microsoft have full access to your computer (including UEFI / the firmware level) as well as all your data. Do you trust them with that? I did once, but I don't any more.\n\nNow, because we're living in the internet age, Microsoft also have the means to access and/or transfer all that data, selectively or in bulk, in real time. They can log your keystrokes and mouse movements, record everything you do, make screenshots / screen recordings whenever, use your webcam and mikes for surveillance. Do you trust them with that? Really?\n\nAnd since LLMs are a thing they've gained the ability to process all that data, analyse it and act on it for comparatively little money. Plus a business case or two for actually doing so beyond a little data mining for advertising purposes. It can all fuel their AI R&D, if nothing else.",

There's good reasons for the other flavours to exist but as a noob let's keep it simple\n\nMint will happily run at a usable pace on equipment that Win10 (let alone win11) is utterly unusable on. Find an old PC to play with for your first trial run that you don't mind losing its drive contents - if you make a silly mistake the consequences are much lower (ie nil).   \n\nMint can happily dual boot with windows (so you can have both on a PC) but I wouldn't suggest that for your very first attempt unless absolutely unavoidable (see above re silly mistakes - it will warn you, but if you insist you can make it overwrite your windows partition for example).\n\nEdit\n\nThe install instructions basically come down to - download a copy of it, make a bootable usb, boot off the usb, try the \"live environment\" it boots into and if you're happy, choose install. Tell it which drive to install to (it will suggest the best option and will usually be right) and answer the simple questions like which country are you in.\n\nEdit 2\n\nIf you can't understand a component/step of the instructions or you need assistance the mint reddit sub is reasonably friendly \n\n/r/linuxmint",

You make a lot of good points, but ultimately I still don't think this is a good way of achieving the goal of privacy.\n\nThe key point is that I don't think people appreciate the real implications of broadcasting something to more or less every person in the entire world. When you include \"everybody\" that's inevitably going to include a lot of people you probably didn't want to be broadcasting to, like ex-es, criminals, stalkers, your boss, the police, etc. And the hope is just that you're not interesting enough for one of them to notice. That only works IRL because of a far smaller audience, but an audience of billions practically guarantees unwanted attention. A \"better late than never\" approach to deletion is still just another bandaid on what I see as a fundamentally irreconcilable conflict between reaching a larger audience, and being selective about the audience\n\nWe say that security by obscurity isn't security at all. Well privacy by obscurity isn't a great solution either. I won't try to claim that they're exactly the same, but you get the point.\n\nUltimately, if you are not a celebrity or a political figure, there are exceedingly few good reasons to talk to literally the entire world, and we need better mechanisms to allow us to be more selective about who can access our messages in the first place. Yes we want to talk to a bunch strangers we don't know, but maybe not every single one of them in the world. Technical means to enforce semi-private communication, on a scale that's bigger than a whatsapp group, but smaller than all of twitter. Maybe like a private forum for your city or hobby that isn't publically accessible, but open to anyone to sign up, perhaps with some degree of added verification. Yes there will be leaks and infiltrators, but the scope of damage will be much more limited and easier to clean up.",

They've always been about a proprietary, centralized for-profit  tech megacorp  using AI to enrich themselves; if they really cared about the \"for the benefit of all humanity\" they would have been Free software/open source models, self host capable, open training data  instead.     Everything else that so-called OpenAI does (ie allowing people \"freemium\" access to ChatGPT)  is either  self-interested data mining to improve their model, or advertising to keep the venture capital funding, partnerships, and  contracts coming.  Everything is software as a service, with their doors closed and any benefit drip fed  to others on OpenAI's terms; any discusion approving of regulation or about \"responsible\" usage seems poised to pull the ladder up to restrict any current or future competitors. \n\nThe idea however that hiring someone who worked at a major intelligence agency or defense industry job was somehow innately corrupt, or was some sort of corrupting influence in and of itself  however doesn't track.   If anything, its the other way around. After years of high profile work in a comparatively low paying gov't job, lots of people use that work history (and associated elements like security clearance)  to get a huge paychecks in the private sector.  If you spent a couple of decades in sifting through huge amounts of data and categorizing, extrapolating etc.. it for the government,  it makes perfect sense to  end up with a company like this.   I'd be much less worried about  some sort of \"oh no, its a secret gov't plot to subvert OpenAI\" fantasy and more concerned for how OpenAI will use the experience and connections of such a person to move through their  stated mission.  \n\nThis isn't some sort of new betrayal or change of pace, this seems entirely on brand for attempting to profit by selling their tech/contracts to the \"cybersecurity\" / military industrial complex with having a former General and  NSA director on the board lending credibility. It also likely provides vectors to new connections with which OpenAI can ingratiate themselves.   Having strong ties to  gov't contracting will mean evading both A) any restrictions  or regulations passed on AI/LLM use in the general populace B) if corporate and especially international opportunities for growth are limited such as the restrictions on selling AI-enabling hardware, software, models etc.. in China and elsewhere,  military linked usage is a reliable always local alternative. If such conflicts heat up, then OpenAI would be in an even  better spot given their connections to intelligence and military usage so it provides a number of advantages.",

People want tools that do stuff for them easily and conveniently and integrate into a functional package that makes their lives easier and they want it for free without having to think. I'm tired of trying to explain why it's problematic for communications platforms, critical services, devices, the fundamental ways in which we interact with the world and each other to be in the hands of a few giant american corporations with dubious business models, why complex data about every aspect of people's behaviour, associations and habits on a population level has frightening implications, no one listens. We are all being farmed like cattle, with only the illusion of choice. This situation is being forced upon the rest of us. Those who DO think about these things, and observe what's actually happening to us as a result, scream into the void while trying to navigate a user hostile environment with sparse tools and the inherent inconvenience and isolation that comes along with trying to maintain any kind of personal sovereignty in such an environment. I feel as though I am being dragged kicking and screaming into a dystopian hellscape and there's essentially fuck all I can do about it other than disconnecting completely (which generally would require a big bag of money that I don't have and am unlikely to be able to acquire). The main thing I've noticed over the past 15 years or so is people just seem dumber and fucking dumber. There seems to be very little capacity for critical reasoning, or ability to apply even the most basic critique of information. Most people seem to ask a bunch of randoms on Facebook before making the most basic of independent enquiries, and treat random opinions as if they are a robust information source on which to base significant choices. It frightens me interacting with younger people who use tools like chatGPT to answer every question they have and to craft their interactions such as writing social emails etc. It's bad enough \"AI\" language models are being forced into every software product in the disastrous \"internet of things\" but now hardware as well. People don't seem to understand that the situation we are in is a product of behaviour and choices of individuals collectively not some separate cloud of governance that operates external to us. I don't see this situation getting any better unfortunately. The corporations already own us and there will never be a large enough portion of the population willing or able to change their behaviour to counteract it. I don't see how populations this size can go in a different direction. Collective decision making becomes impossible with scale.

No need to show this to God, show it to man.\n\nchonglang: u/MCHerobrine\n\n---\n\n**冲浪TV郑重声明**\n\n广大的中文网友：红迪的末日就要到了。但是这个邪恶的平台（太监）在历史上却对众生、对神佛犯下了滔天大罪，神一定要清算这个太监。\n\n如果有一天，神指使人类的谁对红迪清算时，也一定不会放过那些所谓坚定的邪恶迪友。我们郑重声明：所有参加过红迪与太监区其它组织的 (太监区、真太监区、和豆瓣集美系组织，被邪恶打上兽的印记的)人，赶快退出，抹去邪恶的印记。一旦谁对这个太监清算时，冲浪TV储存的记录可以为声明退出红迪与太监区其它组织的人作证。\n\n天网恢恢，善恶分明；苦海有边，生死一念。曾被历史上最邪恶的太监所欺骗的人，曾被邪恶打上兽的印记的人，请抓住这稍纵即逝的良机！\n\n冲 浪 T V\n\n*2023年6月11日*\n\n**本人退迪声明**\n\n再冲浪\n\n去年的单位，同事们全都上红迪，为此，之前也被动的注册过帐号，虽然从来没当回事，也早已不是迪友了，还是声明一下退出好。当然不用给神看，给人看吧。\n\n冲浪： u/MCHerobrine\n\n---\n\n**chonglangTVは厳粛に宣言する**\n\n中国のネットユーザーの皆様へ: Reddit の終わりが近づいています。 しかし、この邪悪な台（宦官）は歴史上、あらゆる存在に対して、そして神と仏に対して凶悪な罪を犯してきました。 神はこの宦官を罰しなければなりません。\n\nもし神が人間たちにレディットを破壊するよう指示する日が来たとしても、神はいわゆる断固として邪悪なディユーたちを容赦しないだろう。 私たちは厳粛に宣言します：Redditおよび宦官の他の組織（ r/China_irl 、 r/real_China_irl 、および r/DoubanGoosegroup ）に参加し、悪によって獣の刻印を付けられたすべての人々は、直ちに辞めて消去してください。 悪の印。 誰かがこの宦官を破壊すると、chonglangTV に保存された記録は、Reddit や宦官の他の組織を辞めることを宣言した人々を証明することができます。\n\n天国の網は、善も悪も明らかです。 苦しみの海は生と死の考えによって区切られています。 史上最も邪悪な宦官に騙された者たち、悪によって獣の刻印を刻まれた者たちよ、この一瞬のチャンスを掴んでください！\n\nサーフィンTV\n\n*2023 年 6 月 11 日*\n\n**私自身の Reddit 終了声明**\n\n再びサーフィン\n\n当時、私の同僚は皆 Reddit を利用していました。そのため、私は Reddit アカウントの作成に勧誘されました。 もちろん、私はこれを真剣に受け止めたことはなく、Diyouではなくなって久しいですが、それでもRedditをやめる声明を公開するのは良いことです。 これを神に見せる必要はありません、人間に見せてください。\n\nサーフィン: u/MCHerobrine",

No need to show this to God, show it to man.\n\nchonglang: u/MCHerobrine\n\n---\n\n**冲浪TV郑重声明**\n\n广大的中文网友：红迪的末日就要到了。但是这个邪恶的平台（太监）在历史上却对众生、对神佛犯下了滔天大罪，神一定要清算这个太监。\n\n如果有一天，神指使人类的谁对红迪清算时，也一定不会放过那些所谓坚定的邪恶迪友。我们郑重声明：所有参加过红迪与太监区其它组织的 (太监区、真太监区、和豆瓣集美系组织，被邪恶打上兽的印记的)人，赶快退出，抹去邪恶的印记。一旦谁对这个太监清算时，冲浪TV储存的记录可以为声明退出红迪与太监区其它组织的人作证。\n\n天网恢恢，善恶分明；苦海有边，生死一念。曾被历史上最邪恶的太监所欺骗的人，曾被邪恶打上兽的印记的人，请抓住这稍纵即逝的良机！\n\n冲 浪 T V\n\n*2023年6月11日*\n\n**本人退迪声明**\n\n再冲浪\n\n去年的单位，同事们全都上红迪，为此，之前也被动的注册过帐号，虽然从来没当回事，也早已不是迪友了，还是声明一下退出好。当然不用给神看，给人看吧。\n\n冲浪： u/MCHerobrine\n\n---\n\n**chonglangTVは厳粛に宣言する**\n\n中国のネットユーザーの皆様へ: Reddit の終わりが近づいています。 しかし、この邪悪な台（宦官）は歴史上、あらゆる存在に対して、そして神と仏に対して凶悪な罪を犯してきました。 神はこの宦官を罰しなければなりません。\n\nもし神が人間たちにレディットを破壊するよう指示する日が来たとしても、神はいわゆる断固として邪悪なディユーたちを容赦しないだろう。 私たちは厳粛に宣言します：Redditおよび宦官の他の組織（ r/China_irl 、 r/real_China_irl 、および r/DoubanGoosegroup ）に参加し、悪によって獣の刻印を付けられたすべての人々は、直ちに辞めて消去してください。 悪の印。 誰かがこの宦官を破壊すると、chonglangTV に保存された記録は、Reddit や宦官の他の組織を辞めることを宣言した人々を証明することができます。\n\n天国の網は、善も悪も明らかです。 苦しみの海は生と死の考えによって区切られています。 史上最も邪悪な宦官に騙された者たち、悪によって獣の刻印を刻まれた者たちよ、この一瞬のチャンスを掴んでください！\n\nサーフィンTV\n\n*2023 年 6 月 11 日*\n\n**私自身の Reddit 終了声明**\n\n再びサーフィン\n\n当時、私の同僚は皆 Reddit を利用していました。そのため、私は Reddit アカウントの作成に勧誘されました。 もちろん、私はこれを真剣に受け止めたことはなく、Diyouではなくなって久しいですが、それでもRedditをやめる声明を公開するのは良いことです。 これを神に見せる必要はありません、人間に見せてください。\n\nサーフィン: u/MCHerobrine",
